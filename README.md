# Notes
some notes and demos or garbage

### "dir"s function
- AUR <br/>
aur & proxy's stuff
- Interview <br/>
the Interview folder is a collection of the "job meeting" I had. <br/>
Now there's only "联通" and "大华", so..later
- Notes <br/>
the Notes folder which in Notes contains some fundenmental things of CS.
- SICP-learn-note <br/>
is SICP(which I never gonna finished) note.
- config-backup <br/>
this folder is the importantest one.
when you reinstall your system, you need to use that to backup.
- vim <br/>
its useless.
I never read them.
- zsh <br/>
just a folder.
