from ghlin:
(1)
	make a dir name XXX.json(XXX is name you named) as proxy, in /etc/shadowsocksrr(mkdir if it doesn't exist)
    write your ssr's config in that proxy.json 
    
    use sudo systemctl start shadowsocksrr-libev@XXX (XXX is proxy if your json names proxy.json)
    systemctl enable   
	systemctl disable
	systemctl stop

(2) use node..  I will ask g later
